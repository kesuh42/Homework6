# Homework6: Weather Dashboard

The purpose of this code is to allow the user to look up weather conditions in any given city, using the OpenWeather API. Once a user has submitted a city name, the page provides the city's temperature, humidity, wind speed, and UV index, as well as a 5 day forcast. The cities that the user has searched are saved to local memory and displayed below the search bar. Thus, when the user reloads the screen, all his previous searches will be displayed for the user to review. Furthermore, on page reset the weather data for the last city searched will remain on the page.
